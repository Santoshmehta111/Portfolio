        <body>Hi, I'm Santosh Mehta, born on the 30th of August, 2000 in Dhore Parsa, Nepal. 
           My parent names are Chetnarayan Mehta and Maya Devi. I have 2 sisters.
           
          From a young age, I was captivated by the world of computers and technology. 
          After completing my schooling, I pursued my passion by enrolling in a Bachelor's program in Computer Science and Engineering. 
          It was an exciting journey filled with late-night coding sessions, challenging assignments, and inspiring mentors. 
          Finally, after years of hard work and dedication, I graduated with a B.Tech degree, ready to embark on my professional career. 
          Currently, I'm working as a Java developer at a tech company, where I get to apply my skills to solve real-world problems and contribute to innovative projects.
           <p></p>Outside of work, I enjoy indulging in my hobbies, whether it's strategizing over a chessboard, cheering on my favorite cricket team, or staying informed about the world through the daily newspaper.
            These activities not only provide me with relaxation and enjoyment but also help me stay sharp and intellectually engaged.
           <p></p>Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science, aiming to delve deeper into the realms of research and innovation. My ultimate goal is to become a successful person, making meaningful contributions to society through my work in the field of technology. 
           Throughout my journey, I'm inspired by the unwavering support and guidance of my parents, whose hard work and sacrifices have always been my guiding light. Additionally, I'm deeply passionate about giving back to my community and hope to mentor aspiring young minds in the field of technology, 
           just as others have mentored me along the way. With determination, perseverance, and the support of my loved ones, I am confident that I can achieve my dreams and make a positive impact on the world.
           <p></p> Dedicated to serving my community as a social worker, I am driven by an unwavering commitment to compassion and empathy. My fervent belief in the power of kindness fuels my endeavors to uplift the lives of those in need. 
           Whether it's providing aid to the homeless, organizing philanthropic initiatives, or offering solace to the distressed, I am steadfast in my mission to be a beacon of hope in a world often overshadowed by adversity. My actions are not merely a duty but a profound privilege, 
           igniting a sense of purpose that resonates deeply within me. With each act of generosity, I endeavor to sow seeds of positivity and resilience, cultivating a brighter tomorrow for all.
